# My Portfolio

This is my personal coding portfolio built with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).
It’s a site that I’ll use to showcase my projects and progress as a developer.

## Features
- Built with Middleman (Ruby-based static site generator)
- Sass for styling
- Organized project pages
- Easy to deploy

## Running Locally
```bash
bundle install
middleman server
